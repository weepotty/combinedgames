<h1 align="center">Welcome to simple games for toddlers 👋</h1>

i built this game for my daughter when she was a toddler and i was trying to teach her colours (and myself to code). it became a fun little project. she was obsessed with animals so i used cute animal icons as a reward. maybe a little too much screen time, but we had fun. after the success of the colours i added several more categories such as fruits, vegetables, feelings etc.
