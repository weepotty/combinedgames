<h1 align="center">Welcome to Combined Games for Wee Ones üëã</h1>

i built this game for my daughter when she was a toddler. i was trying to teach her colours (and myself to code). it became a fun little project. she was obsessed with animals so i used cute animal icons as a reward. maybe a little too much screen time, but we had fun. after the success of the colours i added several more categories such as fruits, vegetables, feelings... and more icons to cater my friends' toddlers (the vehicle lovers etc).

## What I learned

I used vanilla JS and pure CSS (no bootstrap) to practice. This project was key in getting familiar with the DOM.

<img src="https://www.vectorlogo.zone/logos/heroku/heroku-icon.svg" alt="heroku" width="40" height="40"/> This was the first project I ever deployed to Heroku (and maybe deployed, ever). Learned about the process of doing that, linking it to my github and setting it to continuous deploy eventually, but prior to that understanding the difference between local/remote repositories on github/heroku.
