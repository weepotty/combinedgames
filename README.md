> this game aims to help toddlers to learn their colours, feelings, fruits, vegetables.. i built this for my daughter when i was trying to teach her colours (and trying to teach myself to code). it became a fun little project. she was obsessed with animals so i used cute animal icons as a reward. maybe a little too much screen time, but we had fun.
